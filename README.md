# Dynamic vehicle routing problem
## Dynamic vehicle routing problem
###### This code works on Dynamic vehicle routing problems. 
###### Project Purpose: 
###### The aim of DVRP is to minimize transportation costs without exceeding the capacity constraint of each vehicle while serving customer demands from a common depot. Meanwhile, new orders arrive at a specific time in the system while the vehicles are executing the delivery of existing orders. 
###### Algorithm: 
###### I developed a two-stage hybrid algorithm for solving the DVRP. In the first stage, construction algorithms are applied to develop the initial route. In the second stage, improvement algorithms are applied. Experimental results were designed for different sizes of problems.
