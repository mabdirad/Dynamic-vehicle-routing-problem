###### This code works on Dynamic vehicle routing problem. 
###### Project Purpose: 
######The aim of DVRP is to minimize transportation cost without exceeding the capacity constraint of each vehicle while serving customer demands from a common depot. Meanwhile, new orders arrive at a specific time into the system while the vehicles are executing the delivery of existing orders. 
###### Algorithm: 
###### I developed a two-stage hybrid algorithm for solving the DVRP. In the first stage, construction algorithms are applied to develop the initial route. In the second stage, improvement algorithms are applied. Experimental results were designed for different sizes of problems.
